1. Import the csv module. Load and read the UFO sightings data set, from the ufo-sightings.csv file, 
into a DictReader inside a with statement.  Assume the data file is in the same directory as the code. 

Print the field names of the data set. Iterate over the reader to put the data into a list name "ufosightings".

Print the the datetime and state of each.  Put the data in "fball" and print the result.

8. What are the top 3 shapes sighted, and how many sightings were there for each? 

Note: Consider all sightings stored in "ufosightings".

- Create a new list "sightings_shapes" containing values from the "shape" column in ufosightings.  
- Create a new dictionary "count" with values of that column as keys and the counts as values.
- Get a list of the dictionary keys and values using the items() method.  This will return a list of key:value pairs.
Sort the list of key:value pairs in reverse order, from greatest (most sightings) to least.

Get the top 3 and store in "top3shapes".  Print the result.
